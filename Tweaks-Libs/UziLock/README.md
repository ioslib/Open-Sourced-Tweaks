# UziLock
A basic tweak based off of https://github.com/johnnyjwaity/UnlockTimeXI that allows you to unlock the ios device with 1600 or 1400 (Uzi's and Trippie Redd's numbers)
Configure the tweak in settings before enabling!

NOTE: The settings dont update instantly, unlock the phone once before they jump into effect (For some reason)
